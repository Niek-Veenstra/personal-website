    I'm a developer driven by curiosity for how things work from a lower level
    side of embedded systems to the broad reach of modern web stacks.

    I like to write code that not only gets the job done, but is also clean,
    readable, and technically solid.

  <p class="mt-4">
    I appreciate development tools that emphasize on developer efficiency, so i
    can focus on the craft.
