    I'm a developer driven by curiosity for how things work from a lower level
    side of embedded systems to the broad reach of modern web stacks.

    I like to write code that not only gets the job done, but is also clean,
    readable, and technically solid. It should work well and look good under the
    hood.

    I appreciate tools that stay out of your way and let you focus on your
    craft. To me, creativity, extensibility, and a solid understanding of
    fundamentals are what make great solutions and projects possible.
